# BeatPlayer Music Application

This is my first application when i was learning android application developement, most of the things i implement in the application is custom means i almost try not to use 3rd party libraries because i wanted to learn more deep about low level apis of android.


Application will show you the all the songs which are available in your phone using content provider and at the same time it will create the service for the applciation so that you can easily play the music in the background and i use foreground service with notification which means you can also listen to your music even if you remove the application from the background.Application also offers you the albums where you have songs according to their albus so you can listen music based on the albums, also you can searn music in application. It also offers you the good user interface with animation so you will stick to use the application.

### Technolgies : Android SDK , Java, Xml
